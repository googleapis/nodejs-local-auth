# [Google Local Auth: Node.js Client](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-local-auth)

[![release level](https://img.shields.io/badge/release%20level-preview-yellow.svg?style=flat)](https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages)
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@google-cloud/local-auth.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/@google-cloud/local-auth)




This library is meant to demonstrate authentication for sample purposes; it should be treated as a starting point for building an application, and is not a general purpose solution. To explore authentication options, see our [authentication library for Node](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs).


A comprehensive list of changes in each version may be found in
[the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-local-auth/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Quickstart

### Installing the client library

```bash
npm install @google-cloud/local-auth
```


### Using the client library

```javascript
const {authenticate} = require('@google-cloud/local-auth');

async function quickstart() {
  const localAuth = await authenticate({
    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/blogger'],
    keyfilePath: '/path/to/keys.json',
  });
  console.log('Tokens:', localAuth.credentials);
}
quickstart();

```



## Samples

Samples are in the [`samples/`](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-local-auth/tree/main/samples) directory. Each sample's `README.md` has instructions for running its sample.

| Sample                      | Source Code                       | Try it |

The [Google Local Auth Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation
also contains samples.

## Supported Node.js Versions

Our client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).
Libraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of
Node.js.
If you are using an end-of-life version of Node.js, we recommend that you update
as soon as possible to an actively supported LTS version.

Google's client libraries support legacy versions of Node.js runtimes on a
best-efforts basis with the following warnings:

* Legacy versions are not tested in continuous integration.
* Some security patches and features cannot be backported.
* Dependencies cannot be kept up-to-date.

Client libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and
can be installed through npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).
The dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.
For example, `npm install @google-cloud/local-auth@legacy-8` installs client libraries
for versions compatible with Node.js 8.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).







This library is considered to be in **preview**. This means it is still a
work-in-progress and under active development. Any release is subject to
backwards-incompatible changes at any time.
